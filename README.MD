# Miniblog in Django

A simple blog where you can create posts and comment on them. This blog was created in Django and is inspired by https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/.

To launch it, download the application (e.g. with `git clone`), then: `python manage.py runserver`.

The server will then be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
